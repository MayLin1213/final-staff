#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far May and I have tested the bot to make sure it can respond when a key word has been used in the discord chat. Mai is almost done with creating the cards for our bot.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The bot is not able to recieve input from users yet and isn't able to show pictures of our cards yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had a problem where the discord module wasn't working but I found out that all I had to do was update it. Not spam install in the terminal a bunch of times
